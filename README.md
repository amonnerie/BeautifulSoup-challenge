# BeautifulSoup-challenge
## By Andrea Monnerie (with some aid with instructor)

This is a challenge that scrapes html data from a website containing data of planet Mars using Beautiful Soup library. There are two parts to this challenge.

### Part 1
This scrapes the title and a preview of Mars news from the website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html.

### Part 2
This scrapes the weather recorded from the rover on Mars from the site: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. Data cleaning, data visualization, and simple data analysis was performed. Finally, the data collected from the html site was converted into a csv file.
